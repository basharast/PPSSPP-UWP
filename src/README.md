## 1.15.5

Has a lot of options to test, stable

## 1.17.1

Is a quick sync from 1.15.5 to the latest and it's beta and may not be stable as 1.15.5

also it has very annoying bug spent two days and didn't catch it, it will crash once sent to background, even worse if your phone auto locked and then opened it will be already crashed.
