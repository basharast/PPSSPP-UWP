## XBOX (x64)
Please visit [XBOX DevStore](https://xboxdevstore.github.io/), I host only ARM releases

the major part of the UWP improvements were merged already into the official repo.

## Roadmap
My main focus is on ARM architect but I will do my best to push a good support for the x64 version

To help the community to have official release I'm working hard to merge most of the changes in the official repo
